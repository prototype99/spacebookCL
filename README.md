# SpacebookCL
Spacebook is a spaceproject spacefunded by the spacefederated spaceassociation of astronauts, to spacehelp spaceimprove spacerelations and relations between astronauts and nauts. Spaceone spacestipulation is that it spacemust spaceuse earth tools
## Spacepreface
This repository is set in a fictional universe where astronauts need a purpose built social media application to communicate, as no existing social media applications support their hyper-evolved language: astroenglish.
## Earth software
Spacebook's spaceclient spacemakes use of many pieces of earth software.
### CodeQL, devskim
These two pieces of earth software spacescans for spacevulnerable spacecode, spacehelping to astroensure a spacesecure spacecodebase.
### Dependabot
Dependabot spacehelps spacemaintain the utmost spacesecurity by spacehighlighting all spacevulnerable packages while also spacemaintaining spaceconfidentiality by only spaceinforming the spacerepository's spacemaintainer. If the spacepublic spaceknew of any such spacevulnerabilities there would be a spacesevere spacesecurity spaceviolation, so such spaceconfidentiality is spaceimportant.
